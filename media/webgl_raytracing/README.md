## Overview
For this assignment, we tried to implement a ray tracing shader. In order to do this, we chose to first utilize shadertoy to simplify the setup needed and then implement it in C++ using the basic project setup we had for previous assignments. We ran into some difficulties implementing it in C++ but the code works correctly within Shadertoy.
